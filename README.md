Implement a digital version of the classic Galton Board physics/statistics demonstration. A large number of balls are dropped through rows of pegs, bounce off pegs with random left/right choices, and ultimately collect in bins to produce a binomial (and ultimately Gaussian) distribution. Your code animates the balls in real time (at ~30 fps), plays a “thunk” sound on each peg-collision via DMA, displays a live histogram of bin counts, and allows the user to adjust parameters (such as number of balls or bounce factor) via a potentiometer and button interface. Key learning outcomes: fixed-point arithmetic and optimization, DMA sound triggers, collision physics, VGA display, SPI/DAC audio, analog-to-digital conversion, and the statistical link between chaotic micro-behaviors and emergent Gaussian order.
